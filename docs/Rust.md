# Rust Programming Language

## Naming conventions

Snake case is preferred for naming conventions in the rust programming language.

Example: `myAge -> my_age`

During printing the format of the output must be of string literals.

Example: `print!("{}", my_age);`

## Scoping in rust

This is valid for block scope, changing the mutations in the scope.
